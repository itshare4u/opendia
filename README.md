# OpenDia ✳️

OpenDia is an open alternative to Dia. Connect to your browser with MCP & do anything.
> Exposes browser functions through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing AI models to interact with browser capabilities.

## ⚠️ Security Warning

**IMPORTANT**: This extension is provided as-is with no security guarantees. By using this extension, you acknowledge and accept the following risks:

- The extension requires broad browser permissions to function
- It establishes WebSocket connections to localhost
- It allows external applications to control browser functions
- We cannot guarantee the security of data transmitted through the extension
- Use at your own risk and only in trusted environments

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Google Chrome browser

### Installation

1. **Set up the MCP Server**
   ```bash
   cd opendia-mcp
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

2. **Install the Chrome Extension**
   - Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode" in the top right
   - Click "Load unpacked" and select the `opendia-extension` directory
   - The extension icon will appear in your browser toolbar

3. **Configure your MCP client**
   Add the browser server to your MCP configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "opendia": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": ["/path/to/opendia/opendia-mcp/server.js"],
         "env": {}
       }
     }
   }
   ```

## Contributing

1. **Adding New Browser Functions**
   - Add the tool definition in `getAvailableTools()` in background.js
   - Implement the handler in `handleMCPRequest()`
   - The tool will automatically be registered with the MCP server

2. **Development Workflow**
   - Modify extension files in the `opendia-extension` directory
   - Reload the extension in Chrome to see changes
   - Test new functionality through the MCP interface

3. **Security Considerations**
   - Review and limit permissions based on needs
   - The WebSocket server runs on localhost only by default
   - Be cautious when executing scripts or accessing sensitive data
   - Consider adding authentication between the extension and MCP server

## Troubleshooting

- **Extension not connecting**: Check that the MCP server is running on port 3000
- **Tools not available**: Verify the extension is loaded and check the popup for connection status
- **Permission errors**: Ensure the extension has the necessary permissions in manifest.json
